    <h2>  Eliot Champeil is an 18-year-old student who has barely lived in France. Seven years in Morocco, seven years in the Philippines, and one year in Singapore have allowed him to acquire above-average English language skills, despite a lack of natural aptitude in the field. A passion for video games quickly emerged in him, having been surrounded by pop culture from a very young age. Unfortunately, his father and most of his family do not share his passion (except for Fifa). It is for this reason that he turned to solo games such as RPGs: he thus discovered monuments such as Zelda, Hollow Knight or even Elden Ring.
        When it comes to programming, he has basic knowledge of HTML and Python. An internship also allowed him to obtain basic knowledge of Adobe After Effects. Joining Epita is for him a chance to become a part of this industry that he loves.
