    <h2>   Maxime Rampazzo is a young student at EPITA. Following his parents' separation at birth, he lived for 12 years on Réunion Island between the ages of 5 and 17, before returning to mainland France to study. Passionate about computers from a very young age, he discovered video games at his father's house, quite early on. In middle school, he learned to use HTML, CSS, and Python. He expands his video game culture through his social relationships, current events, and social networks like YouTube.

        The desire to develop computer programs and games then developed, especially during 8th grade. He loves to eat, especially peppers, which even inspired the theme of the project. Also practicing drawing and guitar, he will be destined to carry out the artistic section of the project, both graphic and musical. Passionate about far too many different things, it becomes difficult to define him, but we swear he's nice. :)
