    <h2>    
        Holding a French International Baccalaureate, he is versatile both culturally and linguistically : a real bundle of energy ! He was introduced to video games at a very young age thanks to his father, whose profession is related to their creation. This led him to increasingly love the field of computer science, especially with the discovery of Python and Java scripts, as well as the HTML language. By joining EPITA, he hopes to follow in his father's footsteps and participate in the creation of [Worcestershire Fish], through the use of Godot and the C# language in order to successfully carry out the game design of the project.
